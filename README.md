# CNV Analysis and Visualization in the Human Genome

This repository contains the code, data, and final report for our bioinformatics project titled **"Analysis and Visualization of Copy Number Variations (CNV) in the Human Genome"**.

---

## Project Overview

Copy Number Variations (CNVs) refer to alterations in the number of copies of a specific DNA segment within the genome. These changes can include deletions, duplications, or other structural variations affecting large sections of DNA. CNVs can significantly influence gene expression and cellular function, and they have been associated with various conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, and certain types of cancer.

In this project, we analyzed CNV data derived from a case-control study on a specific type of cancer:
- **Case group:** Individuals with the disease.
- **Control group:** Healthy individuals.

The objective was to identify genomic regions where CNVs are more prevalent in the case group compared to the control group and to pinpoint genes that might be implicated in the disease.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Implement statistical tests and machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and associations between CNVs and disease traits.
   
2. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Develop visual tools (e.g., heatmaps, distribution plots) to represent the findings clearly.
   
3. **Final Report:**  
   - Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and interpretations of the study.

## Project Phases

1. **Understanding CNV:**  
   - Study the concept of CNVs and their significance in genetics and disease.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Use R to clean and prepare the CNV datasets for analysis.
   
3. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Conduct statistical analyses to identify CNVs correlated with the disease.
   - Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the association between CNVs and the target disease.
   
4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Use R libraries to generate graphs and plots that effectively showcase the analysis results.
   
5. **Final Report:**  
   - Compile a detailed report including introduction, methodology, results, and discussion.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
   - Install the necessary R packages (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, etc.).

2. **Execution:**
   - Open the `analysis.R` script in RStudio.
   - Run the script to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
   - Visualizations will be saved in the `results/visualizations` folder, and the final results will be exported to `output.xlsx`.

## Deliverables

- **Final Report:**  
  A comprehensive document detailing the methodology for region extraction, analysis results, and visualizations.
  
- **R Code:**  
  Scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
  
- **Excel File:**  
  A results file with separate sheets for gene-related findings and CNV regions.
