# CNV Analysis and Visualization in the Human Genome

This repository contains the code, data, and final report for our bioinformatics project titled **"Analysis and Visualization of Copy Number Variations (CNV) in the Human Genome"**.

## Project Overview

Copy Number Variations (CNVs) refer to alterations in the number of copies of a specific DNA segment within the genome. These changes can include deletions, duplications, or other structural variations affecting large sections of DNA. CNVs can significantly influence gene expression and cellular function, and they have been associated with various conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, and certain types of cancer.

In this project, we analyzed CNV data derived from a case-control study on a specific type of cancer:
- **Case group:** Individuals with the disease.
- **Control group:** Healthy individuals.

The objective was to identify genomic regions where CNVs are more prevalent in the case group compared to the control group and to pinpoint genes that might be implicated in the disease.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Implement statistical tests and machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and associations between CNVs and disease traits.
   
2. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Develop visual tools (e.g., heatmaps, distribution plots) to represent the findings clearly.

## Project Phases
   
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Use R to clean and prepare the CNV datasets for analysis.
   
2. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Conduct statistical analyses to identify CNVs correlated with the disease.
   - Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the association between CNVs and the target disease.
   
3. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Use R libraries to generate graphs and plots that effectively showcase the analysis results.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** R
- **R Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, and other necessary packages for statistical analysis and visualization.
- **Data Source:**  
  - **Cases File:** Contains CNV reports for individuals with cancer.
  - **Controls File:** Contains CNV reports for healthy individuals.
